# I2P Community Virtual Meet Up 

This is NOT related to the I2P Java Dev meetings. Please contribute to core development and attend the monthly irc meetings.

This is once a month opportunity to discuss network infrastructure support, new applications and get to know people in the community.

It is also an opportunity to discuss the I2P technology in terms of its interoperability with other privacy projects, and to invite people who provide digital security training to participate in learning more and helping to shape developemnt and provide insight for use cases and development focus.
