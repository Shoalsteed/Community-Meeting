# Community-Meeting

This is not related to the I2P java Dev meetings.

A once a month opportunity to discuss network infrastructure support, new applications and get to know people in the community.

This is also an opportunity to discuss the I2P technology in terms of its interoperability with other privacy projects, and to invite people who provide digital security training to participate in learning more and helping to shape developemnt and provide insight for use cases and development focus.

We will need consensus regarding a time that works for everyone, and a best day. 
I will suggest Jitsi as a platform so that participants who want to demonstrate an application can do so.
